* ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/xelkano/redmine_xapian.git or download and extract tar or zip file.
* rake db:migrate_plugins RAILS_ENV="production"

Now, you can see a new check box “files” on search screen, that allows you to search attachments by file name and its contents.
Xapian plugin checks for ruby bindings before its startup, if plugin can not find them,it is not activated and this message is going to appear in redmine log “REDMAIN_XAPIAN ERROR:No Ruby bindings for Xapian installed !!. PLEASE install Xapian search engine interface for Ruby" If you see this message,please make sure that xapian library are correctly installed for your ruby environment.

h2. 1.3. Setup

To use stemmed languages on searches, xapian needs to generate stemmed forms for each language and store them on each database.
Before you can use the plugin, you have to populate the omega databases for each stemmed language you want to use:

<pre>
omindex -s english --db /var/www/xapian-index/english /var/www/redmine/files/
</pre>

<pre>
omindex -s german --db /var/www/xapian-index/german /var/www/redmine/files/
</pre>

use *omindex -h* for help.

You can launch this command from crontab, one or two times a day.
The database directories have to be named with language name you want to use, english directory for english stemmed forms, german directory for german stemmed forms,…

After file indexing and plugin setup on settings you can search attachment by name and content.

To perform attachment searches view_document permission is needed, be sure it is checked.


h1. 3. KNOWN BUGS

- When search is performed across redmine database and xapian database, results count is approximate and may not be accurate due to the required effort in database operations to determine this value.

- If you are upgrading plugin version, please, first configure plugin and save settings, otherwise may appear errors in search screen.
